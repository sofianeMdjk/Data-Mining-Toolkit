It is now clear that data is the key for the data mining, before diving into this process it is important to have some informations about the data, for instance it is useful to know the types of the different attributes, some statistical descriptions to learn more about the values or even visualization. 

When we talk about data, it is more precise to speak of data objects that represent an entity which is represented by attributes thus describing that data object. Each attribute has a type, we can 
summarize them in the following categories : 
	*Nominal attributes (That generally refer to names)
	*Binary attributes (As we know them to have only two possible values : true of false)
	*Ordinal attributes (That have a limited number of meaningful values unlike the nominal attributes, e.g take an atribute eye_color it can only take values : blue, green, brown, grey and black)
	*Numeric attributes (It is clear that it is the attributes with a numerical value)
Data attributes can either be discrete if it takes a finite number of values. On the contrary, it is called continuous attributes.

Another type of information we can get is statistical properties of the data. Many techniques can be used to get such intel, we can talk about : 
Measuring the Central Tendency:
	 *Mean : The mean is the average of the numbers, calculated by summing different values of an attributes from different objects and deviding the result by the number of objects tested. However it 		  presents a major issue, when the values are extreme, the results are easily corrupted and that's where the Median technique comes in.
	*Median : To find the Median, we sort the values of the attribute and find the middle number thus solving the precedent issue. e.g: for the Median of {13, 23, 11, 16, 15, 10, 26}we sort the 		 values{10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 23, 26} The middle number is 15, so the median is 15. (If there are two middle numbers, we average them)
	*Mode : calculated as follows : mean − mode ≈ 3 × (mean − median).
Another used technique would be the Measuring the Dispersion of Data: Range, Quartiles, Variance, Standard Deviation, and Interquartile Range (Will be detailed if time permits it)then we can use different graphical displays of these statistical informations.
