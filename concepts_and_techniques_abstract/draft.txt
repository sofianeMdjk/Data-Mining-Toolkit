- Through decades, information technology evolved from the basic file processing, to relational databases, wharehouses thus handling the huge amount of information coming from different sources, its necessity became even more obvious with the avenuing of the internet in the early 90's. Data became present in every prospect of our lives and information, it became a need to extract knowldge from this data and use it to improve productivity in general, and this is what data mining does,it extract knowledge from raw data and create value out of the mining .
To achieve this task, it goes through several steps  : 
	*Data Cleaning
	*Data integration (where multiple data sources may be combined)
	*Data selection (Getting the relevant data)
	*Data transformatioln
	*data mining (Extracting data patterns)
	*Pattern evaluation.
	*Knowledge presentation)
One of data mining's major pros is that it can be on different data structures as Databases, data wharehouses, transactions and some more advanced structures. Regardless to the structure used, the main purpose is to mine different types of patterns such as : 
	*Charamcterizaition and discrimination where caracterization consists on summarizing the data of targeted class and discrimination on comparing the targeted classed with contrasting classes. It's 	     not rare to use both technques.
	*Mining Frequent Patterns, Associations, and Correlations : Consists on mining the frequent pattern appearances which lead to an assocaition analysis that help us evaluate two inforamtions : the 		 support and the confidzncz.  
	*Classification and regression : where classification is the method that allow us to find a model that discribes a certain class and thus help classifying the data that's not labeled. Whereas 	 classification is used on discret data, regression is used to predict continuous values.
	*Cluster Analysis : Consists in anayzing and gathering data that not is labeled. Data is grouped regarding the similarity of the differnet attributes of the data. 
	*Outlier analysis : Analizing objects that do not behave like the general model of the data, it may be useful for fraud detection for example, it is a kind of anomaly detection. 
Different technologies are used depending on the mining method, for instance statistical models are widely used for caracterization and discrimination, verifying the results of the mining. Machine learning learning methods such as supervised and unsupervised trainings are used for classification/regression and cluster analysis respectively. Some database systems have built dat aanalysis capabilities permitting, real time fast streaming of large datasets. Inforamtion retrieval is also used when it comes to searching informations in different tyes of documents based on probabilistic models.
Data mining is used in multiple fields. Business intelligence is a great example of its importance when it comes to extract knowledge from the informations about their custumers and competitors, in this field, data mining is essential. Web search engines are also a great source of applications for data mining, to finds the most accurate informations as fast as possible.
